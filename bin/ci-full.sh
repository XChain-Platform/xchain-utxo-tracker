# bin/ci-full.sh: run EVERY tier this repo's GitHub CI runs, in one process.
#
# .github/workflows/ci.yml fans this repo out as four jobs (test, coverage,
# perf, drift-guards). The pre-push venue gate used to run only `npm run ci`,
# so a push could gate green locally and then go red on GitHub on a job the
# gate never ran (2026-08-15: exactly that, on three repos at once). This
# script IS the local twin of the workflow: every job's run-steps,
# transcribed, in job order. When ci.yml gains or changes a job, change this
# script in the same commit.
#
# Layout: siblings resolve at ../<repo>, which is both the platform monorepo
# layout and the venue gate's work/ layout (.ci-siblings ships them there). A
# sibling a GitHub job checks out is REQUIRED here: missing means fail loud,
# never skip, because GitHub will run the step this gate would be skipping.
#
# No database: this repo's suite runs against an in-process LevelDB + a
# JSON-RPC mock (see ci.yml's header comment), so there is no TEST_DB_* /
# CI_DB_* wiring to do here, unlike the hub-family repos.
#
# All tiers run even after one fails (GitHub reports every red job, so this
# reports every red tier); the exit code is red if any tier was.

# Tier classes. A push grades the FAST tier only: the unit job, the pin and
# drift guards, and the structure and hygiene checks the hook runs before it
# dispatches. The tiers named below (coverage re-runs, perf scenarios) are
# skipped when the gate sets CI_TIER=fast, and each skip is recorded so the
# closing verdict can never claim a green it did not earn. Nothing stops
# being graded: a scheduled sweep re-runs this same script with CI_TIER=full
# on every repo every three hours and before any release or deploy, and a
# red there is tracked down and fixed first. CI_TIER is unset for a hand
# run, so a bare `npm run ci:full` still runs every tier as it always did.
